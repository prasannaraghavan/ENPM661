This a puzzle solver based on the Dijkstra Algorithm.
It already has a built in map but if we change the map we can run the folling for any configuration.
Simply run the .py file and give the desired inputs it will generate a video showing the traversal of nodes and the final path.
To check the map, simply uncomment the map section and run the file.
